Latex style file and template for CSAS Research Documents

__Initial commit 19th September 2014, Andrew Edwards__

Contains latex style file plus an example template for producing DFO Research Documents for CSAS. The latest Res Docs to be published using (or partly) using some of this are our two Pacific Ocean Perch stock assessments [2013/092](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/publications/resdocs-docrech/2013/2013_092-eng.html) and [2013/093](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/publications/resdocs-docrech/2013/2013_093-eng.html) published in March 2014. (Please add to this as necessary).

READresDocTemplate.txt - see this for full details of the files, save me rewriting here. Do read this first.

The initial set of files here are the ones I emailed out to colleagues in the file resDocTemplate-2014-04-28.7z (except here I have excluded POP3CDresDocSubmit.pdf and POP3CDresDocSubmitAccess9.pdf since they are large), with minor edits to the READ...txt file.

I'm hosting all this on GitHub so that others can make and share refinements to the resDocSty.sty file as necessary.


__Next actions / wish list__

1. If you make improvements then please document them, here and/or in READresDocTemplate.txt.  

2. The web accessibility aspects can probably be automated in Latex (rather than doing at the end in the .pdf). Look into this. A web search turns up 
[this site](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/124291/revisiting-producing-structured-pdfs-from-latex) as possibly the most useful. I plan to maybe look into this for our assessment due December 2014, though may not have time.
