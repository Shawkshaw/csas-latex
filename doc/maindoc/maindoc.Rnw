\abstract{}

\Sexpr{fish.name} (\emph{\Sexpr{science.name}}, \Sexpr{common.name}) are an
important component of the bottom trawl fishery in \Sexpr{bc}. They are managed as a coastwide stock,
with a TAC of 15,000 t and catch of 10,679 t in 2014. Prior to the introduction
of freezer trawlers in the mid-2000s, most of the historical catch of
\Sexpr{fish.name} is understood to have been discarded at sea. This was largely due
to proteolysis, which occurs in the muscle tissue of this species a short time
after it is caught, making the flesh unpalatable. In the past five years,
markets have been established for fillets that have been frozen at sea, and
the freezer trawl fleet has taken an increasing proportion of the coastwide
catch.

This assessment fits a female only Bayesian age-structured model to catch,
survey and age-composition data from the years 1996-2014, for management areas
3CD (West Coast Vancouver Island), 5AB (Queen Charlotte Sound), 5CD
(Hecate Strait), and 5E (West Coast Haida Gwaii). Catch data prior to the
introduction of at-sea observers in 1996 were considered too unreliable for
inclusion in the assessment due to unknown quantities of discarding at sea.

The Reference Case model presented in this assessment estimates the female
spawning biomass to have been on a flat to increasing trajectory since 1996,
consistent with the catch and survey data. A set of sensitivity analyses was
done to test the effects of fixed parameters and assumed prior probability
distributions on model outcomes. In all scenarios, there was strong
confounding among parameters representing productivity and scale of the
population, indicating that there was limited information in the short time
series of available data to resolve the population scale.

Management advice is provided in the form of decision tables which forecast the
impacts of a range of 2015 catch levels on \Sexpr{fish.name} stock status relative to
these reference points. The Reference Case decision table suggests that a 2015
catch equal to any of the catch levels tested, ranging from 0 t to 30,000 t
(twice the 2014 TAC), would result in a 2016 biomass above all of the candidate
biomass-based reference points tested, and 2015 harvest rate below the estimated
\emph{U}\subscr{MSY}. Large uncertainty in the assessment is however, emphasised.
The magnitude of catch and discards prior to 1996 is a major source of
uncertainty in this assessment that could provide critical information about the
scale and productivity of this stock. Ageing of archived otoliths from the
freezer trawl fleet is a high priority recommendation.

  Évaluation du stock de plie à grande bouche
  (\emph{Atheresthes stomias}) de la côte ouest de la
    Colombie-Britannique
}

La plie à grande bouche (\emph{Atheresthes stomias} ou flétan noir) est une
importante composante de la pêche au chalut de fond en Colombie-Britannique.
Ce stock est géré pour l’ensemble de la côte et s’est vu attribuer un total
autorisé des captures (TAC) de 15 000 tonnes en 2014; les prises réelles se sont
élevées à 10 679 tonnes. On s’entend pour dire qu’avant l’introduction des
chalutiers congélateurs au milieu des années 2000, la plupart des prises de
plie à grande bouche étaient rejetées à la mer. On procédait ainsi
principalement en raison de la protéolyse qui survient dans les tissus
musculaires de cette espèce peu de temps après sa capture, ce qui rend la
chair impropre à la consommation. Au cours des cinq dernières années, le marché
de filets ayant été congelés en mer s’est développé, et la flotte de chalutiers
congélateurs s’approprie maintenant une proportion croissante des prises
côtières.

La présente évaluation utilise un modèle de population Bayésien structuré
par âge et tenant compte des individus femelles seulement pour capturer,
étudier et recueillir des données de composition selon l’âge, entre 1996 et
2014, dans les zones de gestion 3CD (côte ouest de l’île de Vancouver), 5AB
(détroit de la Reine-Charlotte), 5CD (détroit d’Hécate) et 5E (côte ouest
d’Haida Gwaii). Étant donné que l’on ne connaissait pas les quantités des rejets
en mer, on a jugé que les données sur les prises recueillies avant
l’introduction d’observateurs en mer en 1996 n’étaient pas assez fiables pour
être incluses dans l’évaluation.

Selon le modèle de référence présenté dans le cadre de cette évaluation, la
biomasse du stock reproducteur femelle se trouve sur une trajectoire neutre
ou à la hausse depuis 1996, ce qui reflète bien les données d’enquête et
de prise recueillies. Une série d’analyses de sensibilité a été effectuée
pour tester les effets des paramètres fixes et de la distribution de
probabilité présumée sur les résultats du modèle. Dans chacun des
scénarios, on a relevé d’importants facteurs de confusion parmi les
paramètres représentant la productivité et la taille de la population,
indiquant que l’information tirée de la courte période de collecte de
données n’était pas suffisante pour résoudre la question de la taille de
la population.

Des conseils de gestion sont fournis sous forme de tables de décision qui
prévoient les effets de différents niveaux de captures (en 2015) sur
l’état du stock de plie à grande bouche, en fonction de ces points de
référence. La table de décision du cas de référence estime qu’un niveau
de captures (en 2015) égal à l’un ou l’autre des niveaux de captures
testés, soit entre 0 et 30 000 tonnes (le double du TAC de 2014),
engendrait une biomasse (en 2016) supérieure à tous les points de
références possibles basés sur la biomasse, ainsi qu’un taux de récolte
(en 2015) inférieur au rendement maximal soutenu \emph{U}\subscr{RMS}. On
souligne cependant qu’il existe une grande incertitude à l’égard de
l’évaluation. L’ampleur des prises et des rejets avant 1996 est l’une des
principales sources d’incertitude dans la présente évaluation; s’ils existaient,
ces renseignements sur les prises et les rejets pourraient en dire long sur
la taille et la productivité de ce stock. La détermination de l’âge des
otolithes archivés de la flotte de chalutiers congélateurs fait partie
des recommandations prioritaires.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\Sexpr{fish.name} (\emph{\Sexpr{science.name}}, Family \Sexpr{family.name}),
also commonly called \Sexpr{common.name}, is a species of flatfish that occurs
in the offshore waters of \Sexpr{bc}. \Sexpr{fish.name} are primarily taken by
the groundfish bottom trawl fishery, although they are also encountered by hook
and line fisheries, particularly those targeting Pacific Halibut
(\emph{Hippoglossus stenolepis}). Prior to the introduction of freezer trawlers
in the \Sexpr{bc} groundfish fleet in the mid 2000s, most of the historical
catch of \Sexpr{fish.name} is understood to have been discarded at sea.
Proteolysis occurs in the muscle tissue of this species a short time after it is
caught, making the flesh mushy and unpalatable. In the past five years, Asian
markets have been established for fillets that have been frozen at sea as soon
as possible after capture to reduce proteolysis. There is also an Asian market
for the frills. The stock was last assessed by \citet{arf2001}, who presented
empirical summaries of catch, commercial and survey catch-per-unit-effort
(CPUE) and biological data. This stock assessment covers the combined Pacific
Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) major areas 3CD and 5ABCDE off the west coast
of \Sexpr{bc}.

%% Subsection names must be in all caps
\subsection{PURPOSE OF DOCUMENT}
\Sexpr{fish.name} is managed as a coastwide stock in \Sexpr{bc}, with the majority of
the catch coming from Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission (PMFC) major areas 3CD
(West Coast Vancouver Island), 5AB (Queen Charlotte Sound) and 5CD
(Hecate Strait) (Figures~\ref{fig:cpue} and \ref{fig:main-catches},
Table~\ref{tab:main-catches}). The Strait of Georgia (management area 4B) is not
included in this stock assessment. The 2014 Total Allowable Catch (TAC) was
15,000 metric tonnes, the second largest groundfish TAC in \Sexpr{bc}, after Pacific Hake
(\emph{Merluccius productus}).

The purpose of this stock assessment is to update management advice for
\Sexpr{fish.name} stocks in \Sexpr{bc}, as requested by the Pacific Groundfish Management Unit
(GMU). This assessment identifies reference points for \Sexpr{fish.name} that are
consistent with the DFO Decision-making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary
Approach (\citet{dfo09}) and characterizes stock status relative to these
reference points, using a Bayesian, age-structured stock assessment model.
Management advice is provided in the form of decision tables which forecast the
impacts of a range of harvest levels on \Sexpr{fish.name} stock status relative to these
reference points.

\subsection{BIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND}
\Sexpr{fish.name} are distinguished by their large mouth and arrow-shaped teeth, for
which the species is named (\citet{hart1973}). Their distribution ranges from Baja
California to the eastern Bering Sea (\citet{hart1973}). In \Sexpr{bc}, the species
inhabits depths from 50--900 m (\citet{arf2001}).

\Sexpr{fish.name} exhibit sexual dimorphism. After sexual maturity, females grow faster
than males and reach a larger maximum size (Appendix \ref{chap:biological},
Figure~\ref{fig:vonb}). Theoretical maximum length, $L_\infty$, is estimated to be
$\Sexpr{round(bio$vonb[[2]][[2]][1,],1)}$ cm for females and
$\Sexpr{round(bio$vonb[[1]][[2]][1,],1)}$ cm for males in \Sexpr{bc}, although the
maximum sizes which have been observed are
$\Sexpr{max(bio$vonb[[2]][[1]][,1])/10.0}$ cm for females and
$\Sexpr{max(bio$vonb[[1]][[1]][,1])/10.0}$ cm for males (Figure~\ref{fig:vonb}).
\Amat\ for females is thought to occur around age
$\Sexpr{round(bio$ma[[2]][[2]][1,],1)}$ y for females and
$\Sexpr{round(bio$ma[[1]][[2]][1,],1)}$ y for males. The maximum observed age is
$\Sexpr{max(bio$vonb[[2]][[1]][,2])}$ y for females and
$\Sexpr{max(bio$vonb[[1]][[1]][,2])}$ y for males There were few observations of
fish over 20 y in the dataset, and this assessment assumes a plus group of 20 y
(Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-trawl}).

\Sexpr{fish.name} are batch spawners with peak spawning occurring at depths deeper than
350 m in the fall and winter months, although the timing of spawning may vary
interannually (\citet{arf1995}). The species produces pelagic eggs, followed by
a pelagic larval stage that may last several months (\citet{arf1995}). Fecundity
of this species is poorly understood (\citet{dicosimo1998}). One and two year
old fish occupy shallower depths than adults, but by the age of three or four
years old, they are generally found in deeper water with adults
(\citet{arf2001}). \Sexpr{fish.name} appear to occupy separate spawning (winter) and
feeding (summer) areas, and undergo seasonal bathymetric movement from shallower
to deeper water in the fall and winter (\citet{arf2001}).

Juvenile \Sexpr{fish.name} feed primarily on mobile prey such as cumaceans, carideans
and amphipods. Adults are piscivorous and cannibalistic, feeding on Pacific
Herring (\emph{Clupea pallasii}), juvenile Walleye Pollock
(\emph{Theragra chalcogramma}) and Pacific Sandlance
(\emph{Ammodytes hexapterus}), among other species (\citet{fargo1981}).

\subsection{FISHERY AND MANAGEMENT HISTORY} \label{sec:managementhistory}
\Sexpr{fish.name} has been managed on a status-quo basis in recent years, with an
annual allocation of 15,000 t for the groundfish trawl fleet since 2006.
Before that time, there were no limits on catches or discards of \Sexpr{fish.name}.
The areas of high CPUE in Dixon Entrance seen in Figure~\ref{fig:cpue} are
mainly from this test fishery. The increased catch can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:main-catches}, especially in the northern areas (5ABCDE)
(Panel (c) of Figure~\ref{fig:main-catches}). Unfortunately, due to rapid
proteolysis of the flesh, the fishery was not profitable and a large drop
in catch is evident after 2005 (Figure~\ref{fig:main-catches}) when the test
fishery ended abruptly. There has also been a recent increase in catch from
2010--2014, which is due to four freezer trawlers joining the fleet. With their
ability to freeze the catch a short time after capture, the freezer trawlers
have accessed wider markets than the smaller shoreside boats. The freezer
trawlers' priority catch is Pacific Hake (\citet{hake2015}), but when hake
become scarce on the fishing grounds the freezer trawlers have the ability to
easily switch gears to bottom trawl to fish for \Sexpr{fish.name}. Since their
introduction, freezer trawlers have taken an increasing proportion of the total
\Sexpr{fish.name} catch, increasing from 7.0\% in 2005 to 65.8\% and 79.8\% in 2013
and 2014, respectively.

Prior to the introduction of freezer trawlers, most of the historical catch of
\Sexpr{fish.name} is understood to have been discarded at sea in large quantities due
to proteolysis of the flesh if catches were not landed and frozen quickly
after capture. Prior to the introduction of 100\% at-sea observer coverage in the
\Sexpr{bc} groundfish fleet in 1996, reporting of \Sexpr{fish.name} discards in fishery
logbooks was voluntary. Since \Sexpr{fish.name} were not managed with quotas before
1996, there was little incentive for skippers to record discards. Therefore the
quantity of discards in the pre-1996 period is highly uncertain.

Any foreign or U.S. catches were taken outside Canadian management zones and not
used in this assessment.

\subsection{ASSESSMENT HISTORY}
The coastwide \Sexpr{fish.name} stock was last assessed by \citet{arf2001}, who
presented summaries of catch, commercial and survey catch-pre-unit-of-effort
(CPUE) analyses, and biological data. They reported commercial and survey CPUE
indices that showed cycles but no trends. They also reported lack of trend in
size and age composition data, and no evidence that natural mortality had
changed over time. Based on this evidence, \citet{arf2001} concluded that harvest
rates of \Sexpr{fish.name} off the west coast of Canada were at or below sustainable
levels. Prior to 2001, the stock was assessed by \citet{fargo1998}. A formal,
statistical catch-at-age model-based assessment has never previously been done
in \Sexpr{bc} for this species.

\section{STOCK ASSESSMENT MODELLING}
We applied a female-only statistical catch-at-age model in a Bayesian estimation
framework to assess the coastwide stock of \Sexpr{fish.name}. Analysis of the sex
composition of the catch data indicated that commercial catches have been 80-90\%
female; see Appendix \ref{chap:propfemale}, Table~\ref{tab:propfemale}.

The model was fit to catch data, four indices of abundance with associated
coefficients of variation, and to age composition data from the commercial trawl
fishery and three of the four research surveys. Biological parameters used in the
model, including growth, weight-at-age and maturity schedules, were estimated
independently (Appendix \ref{chap:biological}) and input to the assessment model
as fixed parameters that were assumed to remain constant over time.

Reference points based on Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), including the female
spawning biomass (\emph{B}\subscr{MSY}) and the annual harvest rate producing
MSY (\emph{U}\subscr{MSY}), were estimated, along with reference points based on
estimated equilibrium unfished spawning biomass (\emph{B}\subscr{0})
(Section \ref{sec:FisheryRefPoints}). Harvest decision tables
(Tables~\ref{tab:decisions-base} and \ref{tab:decisions-sens}) were created by
projecting the assessment model one year into the future under a range of
constant catch levels. For each level of catch, decision tables show the
probability that projected spawning biomass in 2016 will be less than spawning
biomass-based reference points, and the probablity that 2015 harvest rate will
be greater than harvest rate-based reference points
(Section \ref{sec:DecisionTables}).

\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Catch Data} \label{sec:catchdata}
Commercial fishing data are presented in this document for the period January
1, 1996 to December 31, 2014. Landings and discards are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:main-catches} and by area (3CD/5ABCDE) in
Table~\ref{tab:main-catches-by-area}. The current assessment fits a female-only
Bayesian age-structured model to catch, survey and age-composition data from
the years 1996-2014, for management areas 3CD (West Coast Vancouver Island),
5AB (Queen Charlotte Sound), 5CD (Hecate Strait), and 5E (West Coast Haida
Gwaii).

Prior to the introduction of freezer trawlers into the \Sexpr{bc} groundfish trawl
fleet in 2005, most of the historical catch of \Sexpr{fish.name} is understood to
have been discarded at sea in large quantities due to flesh proteolysis, as
discussed above. In many cases entire tows were discarded, precluding the use of
ratio estimators or other statistical methods of estimating unobserved discards.
All catch data prior to the introduction of 100\% at-sea observer coverage in
1996 were therefore omitted from this assessment, on the recommendation of our
industry advisors and technical working group. See
Section \ref{sec:future-research} for further discussion and research
recommendations.

The 1996-2014 catch time series was multiplied by the proportion female for each
year (calculated in Appendix \ref{chap:propfemale}), to give a female-only catch
time series. This catch time series was used in the Reference Case and all
sensitivity models presented in this document.

\subsubsection{Abundance Indices}
Four sets of fishery independent survey indices of abundance were used in this
assessment. Each series was multiplied by its respective proportion female
(calculated in Appendix \ref{chap:propfemale}), to give female-only indices of
abundance (Table \ref{tab:Indices}). The surveys used in this assessment were:

\begin{resdoclist}
  \item The Hecate Strait Multispecies Assemblage Survey (HSMAS)
  \item The Hecate Strait Synoptic Survey (HSSS)
  \item The Queen Charlotte Sound Synoptic Survey (QCSSS)
  \item The West Coast Vancouver Island Synoptic Survey (WCVISS)
\end{resdoclist}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\textbf{Hecate Strait Multispecies Assemblage Survey} \\
A series of multi-species groundfish bottom trawl surveys were conducted in
Hecate Strait in May-June of 1984, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998,
2000, 2002, and 2003 (\citet{westrheim1984}, \citet{fargo1984},
\citet{fargo1988}, \citet{wilson1991}, \citet{hand1994},
\citet{workman1996}, \citet{workman1997}, \citet{choromanski2002},
\citet{choromanski2005}). The present assessment only utilizes observations
from 1996 until the survey ended in 2003.

The original design of this survey assigned fishing locations by 10 fathom
depth intervals within a 10 nautical mile grid of Hecate Strait. The survey
was post-stratified using 10 fathom depth intervals for the entire survey area,
thereby treating each depth interval as a single stratum. The Hecate Strait
Assemblage survey was designed as a systematic fixed-station survey. Despite
attempts to apply post-sampling stratification, this approach had high survey
variance (\citet{sinclair2007}). In 2004 the Hecate Strait Assemblage survey
was discontinued in favour of the Hecate Strait Synoptic survey (described
below).
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\textbf{Hecate Strait Synoptic Survey} \\
The Hecate Strait synoptic groundfish bottom trawl survey is part of a
coordinated set of long-term surveys that together cover the continental shelf
and upper slope of most of the \Sexpr{bc} coast. The Queen Charlotte Sound and West
Coast Vancouver Island synoptic surveys described below are part of the same set
of surveys. All the synoptic surveys follow a random depth stratified design.
The relative allocation of blocks amongst depth strata was determined by
modelling the expected catches of groundfish and determining the target number
of tows per stratum that would provide the most precise catch rate data for as
many species as possible.

The Hecate Strait synoptic survey has been conducted during May--June, in odd
years starting in 2005. The survey area is divided into 2 km by 2 km blocks and
each block is assigned one of four depth strata based on the average bottom
depth in the block. The four depth strata for the Hecate Strait survey are
10--70 m, 70--130 m, 130--220 m, and 220--500 m. Each year blocks are randomly
selected within each depth strata.
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\textbf{Queen Charlotte Sound Synoptic Survey} \\
The Queen Charlotte Sound survey has been conducted in July--August in 2003, 2004
and in odd years starting in 2005. The survey area is divided into 2 km by 2 km
blocks and each block is assigned one of four depth strata based on the average
bottom depth in the block. The four depth strata for the QCS survey are
50--125 m, 125--200 m, 200--330 m, and 330--500 m. Each year blocks are randomly
selected within each depth strata. In addition, for the purposes of allocating
blocks, the QCS survey is divided into northern and southern spatial strata.
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\textbf{West Coast Vancouver Island Synoptic Survey} \\
The West Coast Vancouver Island Synoptic Survey has been conducted in May--June
in even years starting in 2004. The survey area is divided into 2 km by 2 km
blocks and each block is assigned one of four depth strata based on the average
bottom depth in the block. The four depth strata for the WCVI survey are
50--125 m, 125--200 m, 200--330 m, and 330--500 m. Each year blocks are randomly
selected within each depth strata. In addition, for the purposes of allocating
blocks, the WCVI survey is divided into northern and southern spatial strata.
\end{minipage}

\textbf{Swept area analysis for Indices of abundance} \\
For all surveys, the swept area estimate of biomass in year $y$ was obtained by
summing the product of the CPUE and the area surveyed across the surveyed
strata $i$:

\begin{align} \label{eq:sweptareaindex}
B_y = \sum_{i=1}^kC_{y_i}A_i=\sum_{i=1}^kB_{y_i}
\end{align}
where $C_{y_i}$ is the mean CPUE density ($kg/km^2$) for species $s$ in stratum
$i$, $A_i$ is the area of stratum $i$, $B_{y_i}$ is the biomass of \Sexpr{fish.name} in
stratum $i$ for year $y$, and $k$ is the number of strata.

CPUE ($C_{y_i}$) for \Sexpr{fish.name} in stratum $i$ for year $y$ was calculated as a
density in $kg/km^2$ by:

\begin{align} \label{eq:cpuecalc}
C_{y_i}=\frac{1}{n_{y_i}} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_{y_i}} \frac{W_{y_i,j}}{D_{y_i,j}w_{y_i,j}}
\end{align}
where $W_{y_i,j}$ is the catch weight in $kg$ for \Sexpr{fish.name} in stratum $i$, year
$y$, and tow $j$, $D_{y_i,j}$ is the distance travelled in $km$ for tow $j$ in
stratum $i$ and year $y$, $w_{y_i,j}$ is the net opening in $km$ by tow $j$,
stratum $i$, and year $y$, and $n_{y_i}$ is the number of tows in stratum $i$.

The variance of the survey biomass estimate $V_y$ for \Sexpr{fish.name} in year $y$ is
calculated in $kg^2$ as follows:
\begin{align} \label{eq:indexvariance}
V_y=\sum_{i=1}^k\frac{\sigma_{y_i}^2A_i^2}{n_{y_i}}=\sum_{i=1}^kV_{y_i}
\end{align}
where $\sigma_{y_i}^2$ is the variance of the CPUE in $kg^2/km^4$ for year $y$ in
stratum $i$, $V_{y_i}$ is the variance of \Sexpr{fish.name} in stratum $i$ for year $y$,
where $\sigma_{y_i}^2$ was obtained from bootstrapped samples (see below).

The CV for \Sexpr{fish.name} for each year $y$ was calculated as follows:
\begin{align} \label{eq:indexcv}
(CV)_y=\frac{{V_y}^{1/2}}{B_y}
\end{align}
where $(CV)_y$ is the CV for year $y$.

One thousand bootstrap replicates with replacement were constructed from the
survey data to estimate bias-corrected 95\% confidence regions for each
survey year (\citet{efro82}). Mean survey biomass estimates obtained from
Eq. \ref{eq:sweptareaindex} with CVs (Eq. \ref{eq:indexcv}) are presented
for the four fishery-independent surveys in Table~\ref{tab:Indices}.

Fishery CPUE was not used as an index of abundance due to the behaviour of
the fishery. \Sexpr{fish.name} are targeted on known grounds, and the location
information is shared among fishermen, so there is a bias towards a high CPUE.

\subsubsection{Age Data} \label{sec:agedata}
Extensive ageing was done for this assessment including 4,787 otoliths aged for
years spanning 1996--2014, from commercial bottom trawl samples as well as the
four research surveys' samples. The samples were aged by the break-and-bake
method which involves placing a large number of otoliths in a tray, baking them
in a specially-designed oven, then breaking them to perform age reads. During
this process, if the person ageing the otoliths finds one which is not baked
enough, they will burn the otolith manually to give it the right contrast for
age reading. This extra burning step makes this method equivalent to the
traditional break-and-burn method in which the age-reader burns each otolith
individually (S. Wischniowski, Sclerochronology Laboratory, Pacific
Biological Station, Pers. Comm.).

Age composition data represented the whole coast, for the following years:
\begin{resdoclist}
  \item Commercial trawl (Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-trawl}):
    \Sexpr{trawl.yrs}, all years (unsorted/discard samples only).
  \item QCSSS (Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-surveys}): \Sexpr{qcsss.yrs}.
  \item HSSS (Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-surveys}): \Sexpr{hsss.yrs}.
  \item WCVISS (Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-surveys}): \Sexpr{wcviss.yrs}.
\end{resdoclist}

Age composition data were input to the assessment models as weighted
proportions-at-age. Weighting was based on a stratified weighting scheme that
adjusted for unequal sampling effort across spatial or temporal strata. For
commercial data, these strata comprised quarterly periods within a year, while,
for survey samples, the strata were defined by the survey design. A description
of the methods used to calculate weighted age frequencies is given in
Appendix \ref{chap:agecompweight}. This is the same method that was used in the
2014 \Sexpr{bc} Rock Sole (\emph{Lepidopsetta spp.}) assessment (\citet{rocksole2014}).

Ageing requests included randomly chosen samples from many vessels, including the
freezer trawlers. Some of these were not aged, due to time limitations of the
sclerochronology laboratory. After ageing was complete it was discovered that the
freezer trawlers were under-represented in the age data. Length data for the
freezer trawler and shoreside fleets were compared
(Section \ref{sec:commercial-length-data}, Figure~\ref{fig:lengthsubfleet}) to
check for evidence that the age data was or was not representative of both fleets.

\subsubsection{Commercial length data} \label{sec:commercial-length-data}
Length data from the freezer trawler and shoreside fleets are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:lengthsubfleet}. These data are presented to check whether or not
there is evidence for differences in the age composition of the catch in the
freezer trawl fleet compared to the rest of the fleet. Since 2006, when freezer
trawlers began fishing for \Sexpr{fish.name}, they have taken an increasingly large
proportion of the catch. However, as discussed in the previous section, it was
discovered after the commercial otoliths had been processed that age data from
this fleet were under-represented in the age composition data.

Females have been sampled more often than males in both fleets
(Figure~\ref{fig:lengthsubfleet}, N values). This difference in sampling is due
to the proportion of females in the population being higher than males
(Appendix \ref{chap:propfemale}). Females did not vary in length significantly
between the two fleets, with both having a median around 55 cm. Males had a
median of around 45 cm for both fleets, except for in 2006--2007, when freezer
trawler samples showed slightly larger males. The low sample size (N=97) in 2006
suggests that this may not be representative of the population.

\subsection{STATISTICAL CATCH-AT-AGE MODEL}

%% Subsubsections are not all caps
\subsubsection{Model Description}
A female-only, Bayesian statistical catch-at-age model was applied to assess the
coastwide stock status of \Sexpr{fish.name}. The model is based on the Integrated
Statistical Catch Age Model (iSCAM) framework, \citet{martell2011}. Full model
details are provided in Appendix \ref{chap:equations}.

We define a Reference Case with fixed and estimated parameters described in
Table~\ref{tab:parameters}. A total of 74 model parameters were conditionally
estimated by the Reference Case (Table~\ref{tab:parameters}). The model
estimated time series of log recruitment anomalies and log fishing mortality
rates; and time-invariant values of unfished recruitment, steepness of the
Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship, natural mortality, average recruitment
and logistic selectivity parameters for the commercial fishery and the four
surveys. Prior probability distributions for the Reference Case are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:parameters} and Figure~\ref{fig:priors} and described in
Section \ref{sec:priors}. Model sensitivity to fixed parameters and to assumed
prior probability distributions are presented in a later section.

In brief, the model was conditioned on observed catch data (\Sexpr{catch.yrs}),
which were assumed to be known without error. The model was fit to the four
survey indices of abundance described above, and to age composition data from
the commercial fishery and three of the fishery-independent surveys (HSSS, QCSSS,
WCVISS). Biological parameters determining weight-at-age and maturity-at-age
schedules, were estimated independently (Appendix \ref{chap:biological}) and
input to the assessment model as fixed parameters that remained constant over
time.

Survey biomass indices were treated as relative abundance indices that are
directly proportional to the survey vulnerable biomass at the beginning of each
year. Observation errors in relative abundance indices were assumed to be
log-normally distributed. The survey catchability parameter $q_k$ was estimated
for each survey $k$, with the maximum likelihood estimate of $q_k$ used in the
calculation of the objective function (\citet{walters1994}). Prior probability
distributions for $\ln(q_k)$ are described in Section \ref{sec:priors}.

Age-composition observations were assumed to come from a multivariate logistic
distribution, where predicted proportions-at-age are a function of the predicted
population age-structure and the age specific vulnerability to the fishing gear
(\citet{rs98}). The likelihood for the age-composition data was evaluated at the
conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the variance (i.e., no subjective
weighting scheme was used to scale likelihood for the age-composition
information). No age-reading errors were assumed.

Selectivity-at-age for the trawl fishery and four surveys was modelled using a
two-parameter logistic function with asymptote at 1. \Avuln\ ($\hat{a}_k$) and
the standard deviation of the logistic selectivity curve ($\hat{\gamma}_k$) for
each gear $k$ were estimated for the trawl fishery and the three synoptic surveys.
No age composition data were available for the HSMAS and selectivity was fixed
with $\hat{a}_k$ = $\Sexpr{base.model[[1]]$ctl$sel[,3][2]}$ and
$\hat{\gamma}_k$ = $\Sexpr{base.model[[1]]$ctl$sel[,3][3]}$, similar to
estimated values for the other gears. Trial runs indicated that there was little
model sensitivity to this assumption.

Variance components of the model were partitioned using an errors in variables
approach. The key variance parameter is the inverse of the total variance
(i.e., $\vartheta^2$, total precision). The total variance is partitioned into
observation and process error components by the model parameter $\rho$, which
represents the proportion of the total variance that is due to observation error
(\citet{punt1999}, \citet{deriso2007}). The total variance is partitioned into
observation errors ($\sigma$) and process errors ($\tau$) using
Eq.~\ref{eq:df17}. The parameters $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ were fixed in the
current assessment (Table~\ref{tab:parameters}) at values that gave
$\sigma=\Sexpr{sigma}$ and $\tau=\Sexpr{tau}$. See Section
\ref{sec:variance} for sensitivity analyses to this assumption. See Appendix
\ref{chap:equations} for further details on the treatment of variance in
this assessment.

\subsubsection{Prior Probability Distributions} \label{sec:priors}
Prior probability distributions for the Reference Case are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:priors} and Table~\ref{tab:parameters}. Model sensitivities
to assumed prior distributions are presented in
Sections \ref{sec:priorsteepness}, \ref{sec:priorm}, and
\ref{sec:prior-survey-q}.

Uniform prior probability distributions were assumed for $\ln(R_0)$,
$\ln(\overline{R})$, $\ln(\overline{R}_{init})$ and selectivity parameters
(Table~\ref{tab:parameters}). A Beta distribution was assumed for the steepness
($h$) of the stock-recruit relationship, with shape parameters that resulted in a
distribution with mean = $\Sexpr{h.prior.mean}$ and CV = $\Sexpr{h.prior.cv}$
(Beta($\alpha=\Sexpr{h.prior.alpha}$, $\beta=\Sexpr{h.prior.beta}$)). This prior
was based on a literature review on steepness parameters for Pacific flatfish
species done by \citet{rocksole2014}. A review of steepness estimates for
flatfish species by \citet{maunder2012} suggested that flatfish steepness using
a Beverton-Holt stock-recruit relationship may be around $0.94$ (where $h$
approaching 1.0 implies recruitment is independent of spawning biomass).

A normal distribution was assumed for $\ln(M)$ with
mean = $\ln(\Sexpr{base.m.prior.mean})$ and SD = $\Sexpr{base.m.prior.sd}$ in
log space. \citet{rocksole2014} reviewed the literature and stock
assessments and assumed a prior probability distribution for $M$ with
mean = $0.2$ in their assessment of \Sexpr{bc} Rock Sole (\emph{Lepidopsetta spp.}).
\citet{arf2013} assumed a value of $M=0.2$ for females in the assessment of
Gulf of Alaska \Sexpr{fish.name}, as did \citet{spies2013} for the Bering Sea
Aleutian Islands stock.

Normal prior probability distributions were assumed for the survey catchability
parameters $q_k$ for each survey $k$, where $2<=k<=5$. Normal distributions with
mean = $\ln(0.5)$ and SD = $1.0$ in log space were selected because the survey
estimates of biomass were derived from swept area analysis
(Eqs. \ref{eq:sweptareaindex}, \ref{eq:cpuecalc}, and \ref{eq:indexvariance}) and
could therefore reasonably be expected to be within 1--2 orders of magnitude of
unity. A large standard deviation was used to reflect ignorance of the scale of
the swept area analysis compared with the true biomass.

\subsubsection{Fishery reference points} \label{sec:FisheryRefPoints}
The DFO Fishery Decision-making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary
Approach (PA) policy (\citet{dfo09}) requires stock status to be characterized
using three reference points:

\begin{resdoclist}
  \item a Reference Removal Rate
  \item an Upper Stock Reference point (USR)
  \item a Limit Reference Point (LRP)
\end{resdoclist}

Provisional values of USR = 0.8\emph{B}\subscr{MSY} and
LRP = 0.4\emph{B}\subscr{MSY} are suggested in the absence of stock-specific
reference points. The framework suggests a limit reference removal rate of
F\subscr{MSY}. Therefore, we refer to the reference removal rate as the limit
removal rate (LRR) throughout this document.

A harvest control rule based on these reference points that is coincident with
the choice of LRP, USR, and LRR would apply a linear reduction in fishing
mortality as the stock falls below the USR, and would cease fishing when the
stock reaches the LRP (but see \citet{cox2013}). This is illustrated for a
hypothetical stock in Figure~\ref{fig:hcrillustration}, where the USR and LRP
are shown as vertical lines and the removal rate is shown as a blue line. We
make the observation that the rate at which the fishing mortality should be
reduced is unspecified in the PA policy, but is usually depicted as a linear ramp
between the USR and LRP (Figure~\ref{fig:hcrillustration}).

There is some uncertainty in \emph{F}\subscr{MSY} (and annual harvest rate
\emph{U}\subscr{MSY}), driven by uncertainty in the trawl fishery selectivity
resulting from possible under-representation of freezer trawl ages discussed above
(but see Section \ref{sec:commercial-length-data}). We therefore also present
alternative candidate reference points for \Sexpr{fish.name} that are less reliant on
estimated selectivity. We suggest an USR = $0.4$\emph{B}\subscr{0} and a LRP =
$0.2$\emph{B}\subscr{0}. These thresholds are consistent with biomass targets and
limits in place in other jusrisdictions including Australia (\citet{smith2007})
and the U.S.A. (\citet{restrepo1998}). Given the large uncertainty in estimated
\emph{B}\subscr{0} in this assessment (see Results, section \ref{sec:results}),
we also suggest B\subscr{1996}, the estimated spawning biomass at the beginning
of the time series, as a candidate benchmark to measure relative fishing impacts
for this stock. See Appendix \ref{chap:equations} for description of reference
points calculations.

\subsection{RESULTS} \label{sec:results}
\subsubsection{Model diagnostics}
The joint posterior distribution was numerically approximated using the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routines built into AD Model Builder
(\citet{fournier2012}). For the Reference Case and all sensitivity cases,
posterior samples were drawn systematically every \Sexpr{mcmc.samp.freq}
iterations from a chain of length \Sexpr{mcmc.length}, resulting in
\Sexpr{mcmc.num.samples} posterior samples (the first \Sexpr{mcmc.burnin}
samples were dropped to allow for sufficient burn-in). Convergence was diagnosed
using visual inspection of the trace plots (Figure~\ref{fig:traces}) and visual
examination of autocorrelation in posterior chains (Figure~\ref{fig:autocor}).
Autocorrelation was minor for all parameters and there was no strong evidence
for lack of convergence.

\subsubsection{Fits to data}
Maximum posterior density (MPD) model fits to the four indices of abundance are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:indexfits}. Fits to the indices of abundance appeared
reasonable. The model followed the increasing trend for all three synoptic
surveys, although it underestimated or overestimated some observations. The
closest fit was obtained for the Hecate Strait Synoptic Survey, although the
smallest observation in 2007 was not fit. The West Coast Vancouver Island
Synoptic Survey observed its highest mean biomasses in 2010 and 2014, and its
lowest in 2012 (Figure~\ref{fig:indexfits}). The model could not reproduce these
large shifts in abundance and estimated biomass to be approximately the average
of the 2010--2014 survey observations for this period. The other two surveys
covering this period (HSSS and QCSSS) were done in odd-numbered years so there
was no 2012 observation. However, neither survey observed a drop in biomass
during this period, suggesting that the low observation in the WCVISS may have
been a sampling artifact, or due to some other anomaly. For the Hecate Strait
Multispecies Assemblage Survey, the model overestimated the three observations
in the earliest part of the time series. The median posterior estimate of
catchability for this survey (\Sexpr{hsmas.q[2]}) was close to the median
estimates of catchability for the three synoptic surveys (\Sexpr{qcsss.q[2]},
\Sexpr{hsss.q[2]}, \Sexpr{wcviss.q[2]} for the QCSSS, HSSS, and WCVISS
respectively) (Table~\ref{tab:parameters-posts}), indicating that the model
estimated all four surveys to be similarly scaled to the population biomass.
The model therefore treated the HSMAS and the synoptic surveys to essentially
be continuous time series. This is not surprising given the absence of age
composition data from the HSMAS to inform the respective scales of the surveys.
However, we acknowledge that catchability in the HSMAS may have been different
from the other surveys due to differences in survey design, and that the fit
obtained for the HSMAS is partly a function of fits to the other surveys and
to the assumed fixed selectivity for the HSMAS.

MPD fits to the fishery age composition data are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-fits-trawl}. Fits were reasonable and there were no
strong patterns in the residuals. Fits to the age composition data from the QCSSS
were generally poor (Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-fits-qcsss}). Age composition data
from this survey were variable, likely reflecting the small sample sizes
indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-fits-qcsss}. Fits to age composition data
for the HSSS and WCVISS were reasonable, with no strong patterns in the residuals
(Figures~\ref{fig:agecomps-fits-hsss} and \ref{fig:agecomps-fits-wcviss}). There
were no reliable age composition data available for the HSMAS.

\subsubsection{Parameter estimates}
Prior and posterior probability distributions of estimated parameters are shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:priorsvsposts}. The median, 2.5\textsuperscript{th} percentile
and 97.5\textsuperscript{th} percentile posterior parameter estimates, and
maximum posterior density (MPD) estimates, are given in
Table~\ref{tab:parameters-posts}. With the exception of steepness, the posterior
estimates did not appear to be strongly influenced by the prior probability
distributions. The posterior probability distribution for steepness, $h$, was
very similar to the prior distribution, suggesting that there was little
information about this parameter in the available data. Sensitivity to the
assumed prior for steepness is tested in section \ref{sec:priorsteepness}.

Posterior probability estimates of $\ln(M)$ tended to be higher than the prior
values, with all of the posterior density located in the right-hand tail of the
prior distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:priorsvsposts}). Normal prior probability
distributions were used for the log catchability parameters $\ln(q_k)$ for the
Hecate Strait Assemblage Survey and the three Synoptic Surveys
(Figure~\ref{fig:priors}). Posterior estimates tended to overlap with the
left-hand tail of the prior distributions for each survey
(Figures~\ref{fig:priors} and  \ref{fig:priorsvsposts}). Sensitivity analyses
(discussed in Section \ref{sec:prior-survey-q}) indicated that posterior
estimates of catchability were sensitive to the mean and standard deviation
of the prior distribution.

Pairs plots of posterior samples (Figure~\ref{fig:pairs}) indicated that
posterior estimates of $R_0$, $\overline{R}$, and $M$ were strongly negatively
correlated with survey catchability parameters $q_2$ -- $q_5$ . This and the
influence of the prior distributions on posterior estimates of catchability
indicated that there was limited information in the available data to estimate
these important scaling parameters. Posterior estimates of $R_0$ and
$\overline{R}$ were also positively correlated with $\ln(M)$
(Figure~\ref{fig:pairs}), again indicating that there was insufficient
information in the data to unconfound the productivity and scale of the
population.

\subsubsection{Selectivity} \label{sec:selectivity}
Gear selectivity-at-age was estimated for the trawl fishery and the three
synoptic surveys (Figure~\ref{fig:selex}). Posterior estimates of
age-at-50\%-harvest ($\hat{a}_1$) and the standard deviation in the logistic
selectivity ogive ($\hat{\gamma}_1$) are provided in
Table~\ref{tab:parameters-posts}.
The median posterior estimate of age-at-50\%-harvest in the trawl fishery was
$\Sexpr{trawl.a50[2]}$ y. This estimate was further to the right than expected,
but was consistent with the available age composition data
(Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-trawl}), which indicate very few observations of
younger fish, especially in the latter part of the time series. Numerous tests of
alternative model configurations did not result in a lower estimate of
age-at-50\%-harvest in the trawl fishery. Female \Sexpr{fish.name} are thought
to mature at around $5.6$ years of age (Figure~\ref{fig:matage}). Therefore,
it appears that individuals have several opportunities to spawn before they
become vulnerable to the fishery. This in turn resulted in estimates of maximum
sustainable harvest rate \emph{U}\subscr{MSY} approaching 1 (discussed in
section \ref{sec:resultsFishRefPoints}), implying that under theoretical
equilibrium conditions, all of the vulnerable (i.e., fully-selected) biomass
could be harvested because the population could be sustained by younger spawners
that are invulnerable to the fishery. We emphasise that this is a theoretical
condition subject to the assumptions in the stock assessment model and the data
limitations therein. We strongly advise against this as a harvest strategy and
suggest that the age-at-50\%-harvest in the trawl fishery is a primary axis of
uncertainty in this stock assessment. As discussed above, catches since 2008
have increasingly been represented by the freezer trawler fleet and age
composition data from this fleet were under-represented. Model sensitivity to
selectivity in the trawl fishery, in terms of spawning biomass and stock status,
is presented in a later section. We recommend as a high priority that future
aging requests should include a representative proportion of ages from the
freezer trawl fleet for all years since 2005.

Selectivities in the three synoptic surveys were also estimated to be quite far
to the right (Figure~\ref{fig:selex}) with median posterior estimates of
age-at-50\%-harvest ($\hat{a}_k$) of $\Sexpr{qcsss.a50[2]}$ y,
$\Sexpr{hsss.a50[2]}$ y and $\Sexpr{wcviss.a50[2]}$ y for the QCSSS, HSSS and
WCVIS surveys respectively (Table~\ref{tab:parameters-posts}).
Standard deviations ($\hat{\gamma}_k$) in the selectivity curves were quite large
(Table~\ref{tab:parameters-posts}), indicating that selectivity in the surveys
was far from knife-edged (Figure~\ref{fig:selex}). This was especially true for
the QCSSS, where ages showed a less clearly defined pattern than for the other
gears, with larger proportions of younger fish
(Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-surveys}). This was likely due to the relatively small
sample sizes for this dataset (Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-surveys}). We recommend
that future ageing requests should include ageing of archival otoliths from the
QCSSS in order to increase the number of samples and quality of information from
this survey.

\subsubsection{Fishery reference points} \label{sec:resultsFishRefPoints}
Posterior estimates of fishery reference points from the Reference Case are
provided in Table~\ref{tab:ref-points} and Figure~\ref{fig:ref-points}. The
posterior unfished female spawning biomass (\emph{B}\subscr{0}) was highly
uncertain, with median $\Sexpr{bo[2]}$ t and credibility interval ranging from
$\Sexpr{bo[1]}$ t to $\Sexpr{bo[3]}$ t (Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}). Posterior
credibility intervals for the candidate LRP 0.2\emph{B}\subscr{0} and USR
0.4\emph{B}\subscr{0} are also provided in Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}.

Reference points based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY) were strongly impacted
by estimates of selectivity in the trawl fishery described in the previous
section. Because the selectivity ogive (Figure~\ref{fig:selex}) was estimated to
be far to the right of the maturity ogive (Figure~\ref{fig:matage}), the median
estimate of \emph{F}\subscr{MSY} was $\Sexpr{fmsy[2]}$
(Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}).
This instantaneous fishing mortality converts to an annual harvest rate
approaching 1, through the equation \emph{U}\subscr{MSY} = $1-e^{-F_{MSY}}$,
implying that all of the vulnerable biomass (i.e., the biomass that is selected
by the fishing gear) could be harvested because the population can be sustained
by the spawning biomass that is invulnerable to the fishery (i.e., fish that are
between 5 and 9 years old). The relationship between age at maturity and age at
first harvest and its effect on fishery reference points was discussed by
\citet{myers1998}, who described a fishing strategy where overfishing could be
avoided by allowing all fish to spawn before they were available to be caught.
\citet{froese2004} also discusses reduction in risks of overfishing by allowing
fish to spawn before they are caught.

It is important to understand the distinction between vulnerable biomass and
spawning biomass. The fishery reference points \emph{F}\subscr{MSY} and
\emph{U}\subscr{MSY} refer to catch of the vulnerable biomass $VB_t$, which is
determined by the selectivity function:

\begin{align} \label{eq:vulnBiomassSel}
VB_t = \sum_{a}N_{a,t}w_{a,t}v_{a,t}
\end{align}
where $a$ is age, $t$ is year, $N$ is the population number, $w$ is the average
weight-at-age, and $v$ is the vulnerability-at-age in the trawl fishery (i.e.
selectivity) (Figure~\ref{fig:selex}).

When the selectivity ogive is located to the right of the maturity ogive, this
means that a larger proportion of the total population is mature than vulnerable
to the fishery. A comparison between vulnerable biomass and spawning biomass is
provided in Section \ref{sec:biomass}.

The median posterior estimate of \emph{B}\subscr{MSY} (and 95\% credibility
interval), conditional on estimated trawl selectivity and resulting
\emph{F}\subscr{MSY}, was $\Sexpr{bmsy[2]}$ t
($\Sexpr{bmsy[1]}$--$\Sexpr{bmsy[3]}$ t) (Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}).
Posterior credibility intervals for the default LRP $0.4$\emph{B}\subscr{MSY}
and USR $0.8$\emph{B}\subscr{MSY} are also provided in
Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}. The candidate \emph{B}\subscr{0}-based LRP and USR
were approximately twice as large as the candidate \emph{B}\subscr{MSY}-based
reference points, i.e., \emph{B}\subscr{0}-based reference points were more
precautionary than the \emph{B}\subscr{MSY}-based reference points
(Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}).

Median posterior estimates (and \Sexpr{mcmc.ci} credibility interval) of
other potential benchmarks of interest to managers (B\subscr{1996},
B\subscr{2015} and F\subscr{2014}) are also provided in
Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}.\\

\subsubsection{Biomass} \label{sec:biomass}
The Reference Case estimates the female spawning biomass to have been on a
flat to increasing trajectory since 1996 (Figure~\ref{fig:spawn-biomass};
Table~\ref{tab:spawn-biomass}). The posterior median (and \Sexpr{mcmc.ci}
credibility interval) female spawning biomass in 2015 is projected to be
$\Sexpr{sbt.final[2]}$ t ($\Sexpr{sbt.final[1]}$--$\Sexpr{sbt.final[3]}$ t)
(Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}). The median projected beginning-of-year 2015
spawning biomass, which incorporates fishing mortality arising from the
observed 2014 catch, is considerably higher than median estimates of both the
default USR of $0.8$\emph{B}\subscr{MSY} and the default LRP of
$0.4$\emph{B}\subscr{MSY} (Figure~\ref{fig:spawn-biomass},
Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}). The 2015 spawning biomass was also projected to be
above the candidate USR $0.4$\emph{B}\subscr{0} and LRP $0.2$\emph{B}\subscr{0}
(Figure~\ref{fig:spawn-biomass}, Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}).

For comparison, posterior estimates of vulnerable biomass and spawning biomass
are shown together in Figure~\ref{fig:vuln-spawn-biomass}. The estimated
vulnerable biomass is considerably smaller than the spawning biomass, due to
the relatively early age at maturity compared to the estimated
age-at-50\% -harvest, discussed in Section \ref{sec:resultsFishRefPoints}.\\

\subsubsection{Recruitment} \label{sec:recruitment}
Median posterior estimates (and \Sexpr{mcmc.ci} credibility interval) of age-1
recruits are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment} and
Table~\ref{tab:recruitment}. The \Sexpr{mcmc.ci} posterior credibility intervals
since 2011 are reasonably broad, with extremely large uncertainty around the
estimate of 2014 recruitment. This is expected since there is no information
in the data about the strength of this year class. While the 2014 recruitment
estimates are shown here, they played no role in projections or the decision
tables. Projected recruitment anomalies for 2014 and 2015 were drawn randomly
from a normal distribution, $\sim N(0,\tau)$. For most of the time series,
recruitment was estimated to fluctuate around the long-term average, with
relatively little variation. This is also evident in the posterior estimated
recruitment anomalies (Figure~\ref{fig:recruitment}). Lack of variation in
recruitment is consistent with the data sources. The age composition data
(Figures~\ref{fig:agecomps-trawl} and \ref{fig:agecomps-surveys}) did not show
any clear recruitment patterns. Until 2005, fishery catches also remained
relatively constant (Figure~\ref{fig:main-catches}) and there were no strong
trends in the survey data (Figure~\ref{fig:indexfits}).\\

\subsubsection{Fishing mortality}
Median posterior estimates of fishing mortality (and \Sexpr{mcmc.ci} credibility
interval) are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:f-mort} and Table~\ref{tab:f-mort}. The
median posterior estimate of fishing mortality is estimated to have peaked in
\Sexpr{max.f.mort.yr} at $\Sexpr{max.f.mort[2]}$
($\Sexpr{max.f.mort[1]}$--$\Sexpr{max.f.mort[3]}$) as a result of a test fishery
described in Section \ref{sec:managementhistory}. Fishing mortality in
\Sexpr{last.f.mort.yr} was estimated to be $\Sexpr{last.f.mort[2]}$
($\Sexpr{last.f.mort[1]}$--$\Sexpr{last.f.mort[3]}$). Fishing mortality
rates converted to annual harvest rates can be found in
Table~\ref{tab:u-mort}.\\

\subsubsection{Relative spawning biomass}
Median posterior estimates (and \Sexpr{mcmc.ci} credibility interval) of
relative female spawning biomass $\frac{B_t}{B_0}$ are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:depletion}. The credibility interval is broad, reflecting
the uncertainty in posterior estimates of $B_0$ (Figure~\ref{fig:depletion},
Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}). The median posterior projected estimate of 2015
relative biomass is $\Sexpr{last.depl[2]}$
($\Sexpr{last.depl[1]}$--$\Sexpr{last.depl[3]}$) (Figure~\ref{fig:depletion},
Table~\ref{tab:depletion}).

\subsection{SENSITIVITY ANALYSES} \label{sec:sensitivities}
We tested sensitivity of the model outputs to the following assumptions:
\begin{resdoclist}
  \item The assumed fixed value of variance parameters $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$
  \item The prior probability distribution for steepness ($h$)
  \item The prior probability distribution for $\ln(M)$
  \item The prior probability distribution for survey catchability ($q_k$,
    $2<=k<=5$)
  \item The estimated fishery selectivity parameters
\end{resdoclist}

Results are presented below. The full list of sensitivity scenarios is provided
in Table~\ref{tab:sens-params-desc}. Reference Case parameter settings are
provided in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}. In all sensitivity runs, posterior
samples were drawn systematically every \Sexpr{mcmc.samp.freq} iterations from
a chain of length \Sexpr{mcmc.length}, resulting in \Sexpr{mcmc.num.samples}
posterior samples. The first \Sexpr{mcmc.burnin} samples were dropped to allow
for sufficient burn-in.\\

\subsubsection{Alternative values of variance parameters $\vartheta^2$ and
  $\rho$} \label{sec:variance}
The Reference Case used fixed values for variance parameters $\vartheta^2$ and
$\rho$ (Table~\ref{tab:parameters}), which resulted in an observation error
term ($\sigma=\Sexpr{b$mpd$sig}$) and a process error term
($\tau=\Sexpr{b$mpd$tau}$) (see Appendix \ref{chap:equations},
Eq.~\ref{eq:df17}). We tested model sensitivity to these fixed parameters by
varying $\vartheta^2$ and $\rho$ to give:
\begin{resdoclist}
  \item $\sigma=\Sexpr{sens.models.1[[1]]$mpd$sig}$ and
    $\tau=\Sexpr{sens.models.1[[1]]$mpd$tau}$ (Scenario 2)
  \item Estimate total variance (Scenario 3)
  \item $\sigma=\Sexpr{sens.models.2[[1]]$mpd$sig}$ and
    $\tau=\Sexpr{sens.models.2[[1]]$mpd$tau}$ (Scenario 4)
  \item $\sigma=\Sexpr{sens.models.2[[2]]$mpd$sig}$ and
    $\tau=\Sexpr{sens.models.2[[2]]$mpd$tau}$ (Scenario 5)
\end{resdoclist}

These scenarios were designed to test model sensitivity to:
\begin{resdoclist}
  \item assumed lower observation error in the surveys
  \item the effect of freely-estimating total variance
  \item assumed higher recruitment variability
  \item assumed lower recruitment variability
\end{resdoclist}

The effect of reducing observation error in Scenario 2 was to slightly improve
the fits to the survey indices (Figure~\ref{fig:sens-sig-indices}), most
notably the Hecate Strait Multispecies Assemblage Survey. The predicted
final-year index points were estimated to be slightly higher in this scenario
(Figure~\ref{fig:sens-sig-indices}), resulting in slightly larger median
posterior estimates of spawning biomass (Figure~\ref{fig:sens-sig-biomass}).
Estimating total variance in Scenario 3 gave MPD estimates of
$\sigma=\Sexpr{sens.models.1[[1]]$mpd$sig}$ and
$\tau=\Sexpr{sens.models.1[[1]]$mpd$tau}$, both larger than the assumed
fixed values in the Reference Case. Fits to the indices of abundance were,
however, almost the same as for the Reference Case
(Figure~\ref{fig:sens-sig-indices}). Posterior estimates of recruitment and
log recruitment deviations were only marginally different from the Reference
Case (Figure~\ref{fig:sens-sig-recruitment}).

Increasing the process error variance in Scenario 4 mainly affected the 2014
estimates of recruitment and log recruitment deviations
(Figure~\ref{fig:sens-tau-recruitment}). The estimated final year biomass
also increased slightly (Figure~\ref{fig:sens-tau-biomass}). As expected,
reducing the process error variance in Scenario 5 had the opposite effect,
with slightly decreased estimates of final year recruitment, log recruitment
deviations and spawning biomass (Figure~\ref{fig:sens-tau-recruitment}).
Estimates of \emph{B}\subscr{0} were sensitive to the assumed fixed values of
$\tau$ (Figure~\ref{fig:sens-tau-biomass}). The resulting impacts on relative
spawning biomass are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sens-tau-depletion}. The rescaling
of \emph{B}\subscr{0} in Scenario 4 (Figure~\ref{fig:sens-tau-biomass}) resulted
in a considerable portion of the posterior credibility interval of relative
biomass to be below the candidate USR of 0.4\emph{B}\subscr{0}.

\subsubsection{Prior probablility distribution for
  steepness ($h$)} \label{sec:priorsteepness}
Sensitivity to the assumed prior probability distribution for steepness was
tested in Scenario 6 by decreasing the mean of the prior distribution and
increasing the CV. This was achieved by changing the parameters of the Beta
prior to give mean = \Sexpr{sens.6.h.prior.mean} and
CV = \Sexpr{sens.6.h.prior.cv} (Table~\ref{tab:sens-params-desc}).
This was a similar sensitivity test to that done by \citet{rocksole2014}
for \Sexpr{bc} Rock Sole. This sensitivity test resulted in lower posterior
estimates of steepness, with median = $\Sexpr{sens.6.h.post[2]}$
($\Sexpr{sens.6.h.post[1]}$--$\Sexpr{sens.6.h.post[3]}$), compared to the
Reference Case median posterior = $\Sexpr{h.post[2]}$
($\Sexpr{h.post[1]}$--$\Sexpr{h.post[3]}$).

Spawning biomass and recruitment estimates are shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:sens-h-biomass} and \ref{fig:sens-h-recruitment}, where it can
be seen that there was relatively little effect of the prior distribution on
posterior estimates of biomass and recruitment. The median posterior estimate of
$B_0$ was, however, much more uncertain than for the Reference Case, with the
credibility interval ranging from
$\Sexpr{sens.6.bo[1]}$--$\Sexpr{sens.6.bo[3]}$ t, compared to the
Reference Case posterior credibility interval of
$\Sexpr{bo[1]}$--$\Sexpr{bo[3]}$ t (Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}). This was due
in large part to the increased CV in the prior distribution for steepness.
Median posterior estimates of other parameters were very similar to the
Reference Case.

\subsubsection{Prior probability distribution for $\ln(M)$} \label{sec:priorm}
The Reference Case assumed a normal prior probability distribution for $\ln(M)$,
with mean = $\ln(\Sexpr{base.m.prior.mean})$ and standard
deviation = \Sexpr{base.m.prior.sd} in log space. Three scenarios
were run to test sensitivity of model outcomes to the mean and standard deviation
assumed for this prior distribution:
\begin{resdoclist}
  \item mean = $\ln(\Sexpr{sens.7.m.prior.mean})$, standard deviation =
    $\Sexpr{sens.7.m.prior.sd}$ (Scenario 7)
  \item mean = $\ln(\Sexpr{sens.8.m.prior.mean})$, standard deviation =
    $\Sexpr{sens.8.m.prior.sd}$ (Scenario 8)
  \item mean = $\ln(\Sexpr{sens.9.m.prior.mean})$, standard deviation =
    $\Sexpr{sens.9.m.prior.sd}$ (Scenario 9)
\end{resdoclist}

Biomass and recruitment estimates for Scenarios 7 and 8 are shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:sens-msd-biomass} and \ref{fig:sens-msd-recruitment}. Decreasing
the standard deviation in Scenario 7 resulted in a lower median posterior
estimates of $M=\Sexpr{sens.7.m.quants[2]}$
($\Sexpr{sens.7.m.quants[1]}$--$\Sexpr{sens.7.m.quants[3]}$) compared to the
Reference Case median posterior estimate of $M=\Sexpr{base.m.quants[2]}$
($\Sexpr{base.m.quants[1]}$--$\Sexpr{base.m.quants[3]}$). Female spawning
biomass was estimated to be on a slightly more increasing trajectory compared
with the reference case model, with much less uncertainty in the first years of the
time series (Figure~\ref{fig:sens-msd-biomass}). The median posterior estimates
of recent biomass were less than in the reference case model, and the
credibility interval was narrower. Posterior estimates of $B_0$ were much less
uncertain than for the Reference Case, with the credibility interval ranging from
$\Sexpr{sens.7.bo.quants[1]}$--$\Sexpr{sens.7.bo.quants[3]}$ t, compared to the
Reference Case posterior credibility interval of
$\Sexpr{base.bo.quants[1]}$--$\Sexpr{base.bo.quants[3]}$ t
(Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}). Convergence diagnostics for Scenario 7 were
poorer than for the Reference Case, with stronger autocorrelation in the
MCMC chains, notably for estimates of $\overline{R}_{init}$.

Increasing the standard deviation in Scenario 8 resulted in very similar
estimates of $M$, spawning biomass and recruitment as the Reference Case
(Figures~\ref{fig:sens-msd-biomass} and \ref{fig:sens-msd-recruitment}). The
median posterior estimate was $M=\Sexpr{sens.8.m.quants[2]}$
($\Sexpr{sens.8.m.quants[1]}$--$\Sexpr{sens.8.m.quants[3]}$).
This can be compared to estimates from the Reference Case (see above and
Table~\ref{tab:parameters-posts}). Increasing the mean in Scenario 9 resulted
in a re-scaling of the estimated population size, with slightly larger
estimates of biomass and recruitment (Figures~\ref{fig:sens-m-biomass} and
\ref{fig:sens-m-recruitment}). The median posterior estimate was
$M=\Sexpr{sens.9.m.quants[2]}$
($\Sexpr{sens.9.m.quants[1]}$--$\Sexpr{sens.9.m.quants[3]}$).

Model outcomes were therefore influenced by the assumed prior probability
distribution for $\ln(M)$. Alternative assumptions for the mean and standard
deviation of the prior tended to increase the median and credibility interval
of posterior estimates of $B_0$ and recent spawning biomass.

\subsubsection{Prior probablity distribution for survey
  catchability ($q_k$)} \label{sec:prior-survey-q}
The Reference Case assumed a normal prior probability distribution for
$\ln(q_k)$, with mean = $\ln(\Sexpr{q.mean})$ and
standard deviation = \Sexpr{q.sd} in log space, for all surveys
$k$, $2<=k<=5$. Two scenarios were run to test sensitivity of model outcomes
to the mean and standard deviation assumed for this prior distribution:
\begin{resdoclist}
  \item mean = $\ln(\Sexpr{sens.10.q.mean})$,
    standard deviation = \Sexpr{sens.10.q.sd} (Scenario 10)
  \item mean = $\ln(\Sexpr{sens.11.q.mean})$,
    standard deviation = \Sexpr{sens.11.q.sd} (Scenario 11)
\end{resdoclist}

Increasing the mean of the prior distribution in Scenario 10 resulted in higher
posterior estimates of $q_k$ for all surveys compared to the reference case model
(Table~\ref{tab:sens-params-desc-q}). Correspondingly, posterior estimates of
spawning biomass and recruitment were lower than in the Reference Case
(Figures~\ref{fig:sens-q-biomass} and \ref{fig:sens-q-recruitment}). Conversely,
increasing the standard deviation of the prior distribution in Scenario 11
resulted in lower posterior estimates of $q_k$ for all surveys. Correspondingly,
estimates of spawning biomass and recruitment were higher than in the Reference
Case, with a much broader credible interval (Figures~\ref{fig:sens-qsd-biomass}
and \ref{fig:sens-qsd-recruitment}).

While Scenario 10 illustrates that the assumed prior probability distribution did
affect posterior estimates of $q_k$ for all surveys, we do not consider a prior
centred on 1 to be reasonable, given that the swept area methodology described in
Eqs. \ref{eq:sweptareaindex} -- \ref{eq:indexcv} did not attempt to inflate
estimated biomass for the whole coast. The lower posterior estimates for $q_k$
obtained for all surveys in Scenario 11, may or may not be plausible, given the
lack of information in the data for informing population scale in this
assessment.

\subsubsection{Effect of fixing fishery selectivity parameters}
In an earlier section, we noted that the estimated selectivity ogive for the
trawl fishery was quite far to the right of the maturity ogive
(Figure~\ref{fig:selex}), resulting in estimates of \emph{U}\subscr{MSY}
approaching 1. We concluded that the estimated age-at-50\%-harvest in the trawl
fishery (median = \Sexpr{trawl.a50[2]} y) was consistent with the fishery age
composition data (Figure~\ref{fig:agecomps-trawl}) but that these data may not
be representative of ages in the freezer trawl fleet due to lack of age samples
from this fleet. While we recommend ageing of archival otoliths from the
freezer trawl fleet as a future research priority, we ran two simple scenarios
in the current assessment to evaluate the effect of alternative fishery
selectivity ogives on model outcomes. Trial runs suggested that fixing
age-at-50\%-harvest at lower values resulted in poor fits to the age composition
data and poor model convergence. Therefore, for the two sensitvity runs
presented here, the fishery age composition data were removed from the
assessment and two alternative fixed ages-at-50\%-harvest were assumed:

\begin{resdoclist}
  \item selectivity ogive = maturity ogive (Scenario 12)
  \item age-at-50\%-harvest = \Sexpr{s13.trawl.a50} y (Scenario 13)
\end{resdoclist}

Trawl selectivity ogives estimated in the Reference Case (MPD) and fixed in
Scenarios 12 and 13 are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sens-trawlsel-selex}. As expected,
the effect of reducing the age-at-50\%-harvest in the trawl fishery was a large
reduction in estimated female spawning biomass
(Figure~\ref{fig:sens-trawl-selex-biomass}), a reduction in estimated
\emph{U}\subscr{MSY} and a corresponding increase in \emph{B}\subscr{MSY}
(Figure~\ref{fig:sens-trawl-selex-ref-points}). Assuming a lower
age-at-50\%-harvest in the trawl fishery could therefore result in more
precautionary advice due to lower spawning biomass, and because the vulnerable
biomass would contain a greater proportion of younger fish.

Scenarios 12 and 13 are speculative as there is currently no evidence to support
an assumption of a lower age-at-50\%-harvest in the trawl fishery. These two
scenarios are presented as "what-if" scenarios to illustrate the potential
impacts of over-estimating age-at-50\%-harvest in the trawl fishery.

\section{RECOMMENDATIONS AND YIELD OPTIONS}

\subsection{DECISION TABLES} \label{sec:DecisionTables}

\subsubsection{Reference Case}
Performance measures were calculated over a sequence of alternative
\Sexpr{sbt.final.yr} projected catch levels and are based on
one-year projections to \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr + 1}. Projected,
bias-corrected log recruitment anomalies in \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr - 1}
and \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr} were drawn randomly from a normal distribution,
$\sim N(0,\tau)$.

Median (and \Sexpr{mcmc.ci} credibility interval) posterior estimates of
reference points (MSY and $B_0$-based reference points) and benchmarks
($B_{\Sexpr{sbt.first.yr}}$, $B_{\Sexpr{sbt.final.yr}}$,
$F_{\Sexpr{last.f.mort.yr}}$) were provided in Table~\ref{tab:ref-points}.
Decision tables are presented showing predicted probabilities of
undesirable states under alternative \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr} projected catch
levels. An undesirable biomass-based performance measure is defined to occur
when the \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr + 1} projected female spawning biomass is below
the candidate reference point or benchmark, i.e., the ratio
$B_{\Sexpr{sbt.final.yr + 1}}/B_{ReferencePoint} < 1$. An
undesirable fishing mortality-based performance measure is defined to occur
when projected \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr} fishing mortality is above the reference
point, i.e., $F_{\Sexpr{last.f.mort.yr + 1}}/F_{ReferencePoint} > 1$.

Probabilities in the decision tables are measured as the proportion of
burned-in posterior samples that meet criteria above (i.e., proportion of
posterior samples \textless 1 for biomass-based performance measures; and
proportion of posterior samples \textgreater 1 for fishing mortality-based
performance measures).

The Reference Case decision table is presented in
Table~\ref{tab:decisions-base}. Alternative \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr}
female-only catch levels are presented from \Sexpr{min.tac} t to
\Sexpr{max.tac} t. Catches are shown in 2,000~t increments from zero to
10,000~t; then in 1,000~t increments between 10,000~t and 20,000~t; and then
in 2,000~t increments from 22,000~t to 30,000~t. A catch level of 50,000~t is
also given as requested by the review committee.

The model-predicted probability of the \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr + 1} female spawning
biomass being below the \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr} female spawning biomass ranged
from \Sexpr{tac.0.prob}\% under no \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr} catch to
\Sexpr{tac.30.prob}\% under 30,000 t, which is double the current total TAC.
At 50,000 t, the probability is \Sexpr{tac.50.prob}\%. The probability of being
below the candidate USR of 0.4\emph{B}\subscr{0} ranged between
\Sexpr{min.tac.4b0}\% and \Sexpr{max.tac.4b0}\% over the range of catch levels
considered. The probability of being below the candidate USR of
0.8\emph{B}\subscr{MSY} was 0\% over the range of catch levels considered. The
probability of being below the both candidate LRPs of 0.2\emph{B}\subscr{0} or
0.4\emph{B}\subscr{MSY} was 0\% over the range of catch levels considered. The
probability that the \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr + 1} female spawning biomass would be
less than the \Sexpr{sbt.first.yr} female spawning biomass ranged from
\Sexpr{min.tac.depl}\% to \Sexpr{max.tac.depl}\% over the range of catch levels
considered.

The model-predicted probability of the \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr} harvest rate
being greater than the \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr - 1} harvest rate was 0\% under a
\Sexpr{sbt.final.yr} catch between 0 and 8,000~t, building up to a
probability of 100\% at 13,000~t. However, the probability that the
\Sexpr{sbt.final.yr} harvest rate would exceed \emph{U}\subscr{MSY} was
0\% under all catch levels considered (Table~\ref{tab:decisions-base}). As
discussed, the reason for posterior \emph{U}\subscr{MSY} estimates approaching
1 (Figure~\ref{fig:ref-points}) was due to the location of the estimated trawl
selectivity-at-age ogive, far to the right of the maturity-at-age ogive.
Sensitivity of catch advice to the estimated trawl selectivity is presented
in the next section.

\subsubsection{Alternative decision table}
For comparison, we also present a decision table using the Scenario 12 model
(Table~\ref{tab:decisions-sens}), where selectivity-at-age in the trawl fishery
was fixed to be the same as maturity-at-age
(see Table~\ref{tab:sens-params-desc}). Scenario 12 had the lowest estimates
of biomass of all the sensitivity scenarios and represents a worse-case
``what-if'' scenario.

The decision table generated using the Scenario 12 model had lower probabilities
of the \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr + 1} spawning biomass being below any of the
biomass-based reference points and benchmarks presented
(Table~\ref{tab:decisions-sens}). This was because fixing the trawl selectivity
with a younger age-at-50\%-harvest had the effect of reducing the scale of the
whole model, including estimates of \emph{B}\subscr{0}
(Figure~\ref{fig:sens-trawl-selex-biomass}) and \emph{B}\subscr{MSY}
(Figure~\ref{fig:sens-trawl-selex-ref-points}). Therefore, although projected
spawning biomass was smaller than in the Reference Case, the \emph{B}\subscr{0}
and \emph{B}\subscr{MSY}-based reference points were also lower, resulting in
similar probabilities as in the Reference Case model.

Similarly, despite posterior \emph{U}\subscr{MSY} estimates being lower in
Scenario 12 (Figure~\ref{fig:sens-trawl-selex-ref-points}), the probabilities
of the \Sexpr{sbt.final.yr} harvest rate exceeding the
\Sexpr{sbt.final.yr - 1} harvest rate were lower than for the Reference Case
model. This is because the posterior estimated vulnerable biomass was actually
larger than in the Reference Case model because a much larger proportion of
the total biomass was vulnerable to the fishing gear due to the assumed shift
in selectivity to include younger fish. As for the Reference Case, the
probability that the 2015 harvest rate would exceed \emph{U}\subscr{MSY}
was 0\% under all catch levels considered.

As with all fishery stock assessments, the uncertainty presented in this
assessment is under-representative of the true uncertainty regarding the status
of the \Sexpr{fish.name} population. We therefore urge caution with the advice presented
in Tables~\ref{tab:decisions-base} and \ref{tab:decisions-sens}. The magnitude of
catch and discards prior to \Sexpr{sbt.first.yr} is a major source of uncertainty
in this assessment. The short time series of catch and surveys that were
available in this assessment were relatively uninformative about the scale of
the population, evidence for which can be seen in the high parameter correlations
(Figure~\ref{fig:pairs}) and the influence of the prior probability distributions
for the survey catchability parameters (Section \ref{sec:prior-survey-q}). If
reliable pre-\Sexpr{sbt.first.yr} catch data had been available, the stock
assessment and harvest advice may have been very different to those presented
here.

\section{FUTURE RESEARCH AND DATA REQUIREMENTS} \label{sec:future-research}
As with all fishery stock assessments, there are two major types of
uncertainty in the advice presented in this document:

\begin{resdoclist}
  \item Uncertainty in the estimates of model parameters within the assessment
  \item Structural uncertainty arising from processes and data that were not
    included in the assessment
\end{resdoclist}
